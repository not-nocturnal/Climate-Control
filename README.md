# WARNING FOR ANYONE UPGRADING FROM A PREVIOUS VERSION
***\>\> If using with Biomes O' Plenty, this will likely create some degree of chunk wall issues in existing worlds \<\<***

Whether this matters or not is up to you, but please be aware of this before installing.  
How it might interact depends on your current version, as well as whether or not you have BoP sub-biomes enabled in the config. See the following table for what to expect:

Tropical landmasses stopping generation abruptly looks quite jarring as the volcano parts of them are quite tall, however they are confined to deep ocean, so there's a good chance it would be out of sight and out of mind. Sub-biomes on the other hand are tricky, as it heavily depends on which (BoP) sub-biome capable biomes you happen to have partially explored, and where in those they might generate. How noticeable it is depends heavily on the biome and your luck. When in doubt, just take a backup, load up your world and check around anywhere you care about to see if there's anything egregious. I've linked an imgur album [here](https://imgur.com/a/2PL9cXX) of some examples I found during my testing. Keep in mind these were generated intentionally, so how it is for you may vary a lot.

**Also, this version has been minimally tested and only with GTNH-2.5.1, so use at your own risk - I strongly advise making a backup of your world prior to upgrading, and making sure you are ok with how new chunks are generating before continuing to play.**

### KNOWN INCOMPATIBILITIES/ISSUES
Realistic World Gen - ***remove it or biome generation will be extremely broken***

***\>\> Quitting to main menu and creating or loading worlds will result in broken biome generation until MC is restarted \<\<***

## 0.9.2-custom changes
* Fixed giant BoP tropical landmasses generating in deep ocean (primarily noticeable with continental worlds)
* Re-added BoP sub-biome generation that was missing in 0.8.2/0.9.2
* Added extra multi-climate distributions to go along with 'PLAINS' and 'MEDIUM'. The full list is now as follows:
  * Base climates: SNOWY, COOL, WARM, HOT, OCEAN, DEEP_OCEAN
  * Two Climates: SNOWYCOOL, SNOWYWARM, SNOWYHOT, COOLWARM (alias: MEDIUM), COOLHOT, WARMHOT
  * Three climates: NOTHOT, NOTWARM, NOTCOOL, NOTSNOWY (alias: PLAINS)
  * Misc: LAND (all four land climates), WATER (both water climates), ALL (both land and water)

Note: Configs generated by this version are not compatible with versions not on this branch. If you want to switch to a different version while keeping your config, find and replace any instances of COOLWARM with MEDIUM and any instances of NOTSNOWY with PLAINS in your config files. Likewise, if you were using any of the climate distributions added by this version, you would need to change them to regular ones, though doing this would probably affect biome placement and result in chunk walls/some abrupt biome changes.

Climate control allows you control climate zones, ocean sizes, biome frequencies, and continent sizes. Make Minecraft worlds into Yourcraft worlds!

Set climate zones to smaller, more manageable sizes so you can find a variety of biomes more easily.

Prevent hot biome-cold biome transitions, if you want, or mix all the biomes together.

Change the frequencies of common biomes and climate zones to occur as often or as rarely as you want.

Restore true oceans to 1.7, or keep a universal continent with large lakes.

Create a variety of land sizes, from giant continents tens of thousands of blocks across to islands that fit on a single map.

Make climate bands to mimic an earthlike world.

Set initial spawn area to any land area anywhere.
